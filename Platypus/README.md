Platypus

Background: Mr. Burns doesn't care about almost anything ... but himself and his money. So, when his power plant leaked radioactive gooo that caused several species of wildlife to go extinct, he was only concerned with the public perception as it might effect his income and possible jail time. After the appearance of the three-eyed fish, Blinky, other rumors surfaced around the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. One of them is high concern over the mutation rate of the rare Springfield molted platypus. With barely more than 50 left in the wild, the word "extinction" has been tossed around. So, to quell the media, Mr. Burns had 30 of them captured, dissected, and analysed to check for signs of mutation. He found that the mutation rate is 2% each month, but when they do mutate, they become sterile and cannot reproduce. With this information, he wants to create one of those newfangled computer simulations that the press loves so much. That's where you come in!
